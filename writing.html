                Writing
        </title>
        <p>
                Writing was never a hobby of mine in the first place, it all started
                when i read this quote which said: 
                <em><strong>
                        "If you cantfind the book you want, even after you have searched; 
                        just simply write one."
                </strong></em>
                So yes thats the vliche start of my writing journey, honestly it feels 
                great to write about stuff, and me completly honest
                <em>
                        <h3>Honest: yes </h3>
                </em>
                Writing gives you an opputunity to explore yourself, it provies you with
                a platform where you can come face to face with what you are and what your
                wild thoughts say.
        </p>
